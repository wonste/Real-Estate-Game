# Real Estate Game

Real Estate Game allows two or more people to play a very simplified version of Monopoly.

Players start at the "GO" space on the board. Players take turns rolling a single die (values 1-6), and moving around the board spaces.  The spaces are arranged in a circle, and players will pass each space repeatedly. Each player receives a certain amount of money at the start, and also every time they land on or pass the "GO" space. Each space on the board may be purchased except for "GO". Once purchased, the player owner charges rent to other players who land on the space. When a player runs out of money, that player becomes inactive, and cannot move or own spaces. The game continues until all players, but one, have run out of money. The last player with money is declared the winner.
